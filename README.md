# FocusFlow MVP Implementation Strategy

## 1. Core Features for MVP

1. Kanban Board (Trello-like)
2. Productivity Homepage
3. Basic Sidebar
4. Simple Pomodoro Timer

## 2. Technology Stack

- HTML5, CSS3, and TypeScript for the frontend
- React 18 for building the Single Page Application (SPA)
- Next.js 13 for server-side rendering and routing
- Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design
- IndexedDB for local data storage

## 3. Data Management

- Use IndexedDB for offline data storage
- Implement data models for tasks, boards, lists, and user preferences
- Ensure all data operations are synchronous and local
- Utilize React Query for efficient data fetching and caching

## 4. Feature Implementation

### 4.1 Kanban Board (Trello-like)

- Create a drag-and-drop interface using react-beautiful-dnd
- Implement customizable lists (columns) with the ability to add, rename, and delete
- Allow adding, editing, moving, and archiving cards (tasks)
- Implement card features:
  - Title and description
  - Due dates and reminders
  - Labels and color coding
  - Checklists
  - Attachments (local file references)
  - Comments
- Enable board customization (background, visibility)
- Implement board sharing functionality (for future multi-user support)
- Store board state in IndexedDB
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for layout and styling

### 4.2 Productivity Homepage

- Design a simple, clean interface displaying:
  - Kanban board overview with recent activity
  - Top priority tasks across all boards
  - Current date and time
  - Quick-add card functionality
- Fetch and display data from IndexedDB using React Query
- Utilize Tailwind CSS utility classes for responsive design

### 4.3 Basic Sidebar

- Create a collapsible sidebar using React components and Tailwind CSS
- Include:
  - Navigation to different boards
  - Quick-add card functionality
  - Mini view of top priority tasks
  - Pomodoro timer controls
  - Search functionality across all boards and cards
- Implement dark theme styling using Tailwind's dark mode classes

### 4.4 Simple Pomodoro Timer

- Implement a basic timer with preset work/break intervals
- Use React hooks for timer functionality
- Provide start, pause, and reset controls styled with Tailwind CSS
- Implement browser notifications for audio-visual alerts
- Allow customization of work/break durations

## 5. User Interface Design

- Design a clean, minimalist UI using Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Implement a dark theme by default using Tailwind's dark mode
- Use a limited color palette for consistency, defined in tailwind.config.js
- Ensure responsive design for various screen sizes using Tailwind's responsive utilities
- Implement basic animations for smooth user experience with Tailwind's transition classes
- Create custom card and list designs mimicking Trello's aesthetic

## 6. SPA Setup

- Set up a Next.js project with TypeScript support
- Implement Next.js App Router for navigation between different views (boards, cards)
- Use React Context API or Redux Toolkit for state management across components
- Configure Tailwind CSS for the project

## 7. Offline Functionality

- Implement a Service Worker for offline caching using next-pwa
- Ensure all features work without an internet connection
- Implement error handling for offline scenarios
- Sync data when connection is restored (for future online functionality)

## 8. Testing

- Develop unit tests for React components using React Testing Library and Jest
- Perform end-to-end testing using Cypress
- Test data persistence across browser restarts
- Ensure dark theme and responsive design are working correctly across different devices
- Test drag-and-drop functionality extensively

## 9. Performance Optimization

- Minimize DOM manipulation by leveraging React's virtual DOM
- Use efficient data structures for task and board management
- Implement lazy loading for Kanban board tasks and routes using Next.js dynamic imports
- Optimize Tailwind CSS by purging unused styles in production
- Implement virtual scrolling for boards with many cards using react-window

## 10. Documentation

- Create inline code documentation
- Develop a comprehensive user guide for application usage
- Document data models and storage schema
- Include documentation on Tailwind CSS usage and custom configurations
- Provide API documentation for future extensibility

## 11. Deployment

- Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Deploy the Next.js app to a serverless platform (e.g., Vercel)
- Implement basic usage analytics using a service like Plausible or a self-hosted solution
- Ensure proper bundling and minification of Tailwind CSS for production

## 12. Future Considerations

- Plan for modular code structure to ease future feature additions
- Design data models with potential cloud sync in mind
- Consider progressive web app (PWA) implementation for enhanced offline capabilities
- Explore advanced Tailwind CSS features like custom plugins for extending functionality
- Implement real-time collaboration features using WebSockets or Firebase
- Develop integrations with popular tools and services
- Create mobile apps for iOS and Android using React Native
